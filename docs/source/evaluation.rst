Future work
-----------

We have laid a solid foundation for future work on CopyClare. Our research and code documentation will
should set future team on the right path to begin.

We believe that future work on this project should be on:

- Calculating accuracy - a more robust way of comparing two videos is needed for advanced exercises
- Create a way for the data to be shared online, so physiotherapists can monitor their patient's progress
- Perform usability testing with the app to get feedback to improve the UX/UI
- Experimentation with various types of cameras to see its effect on accuracy
