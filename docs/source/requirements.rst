============

Project background
------------------

CopyClare is an application that aims to explore and capture the rehabilitation process. Physiotherapists are constantly in high demand, making it hard to schedule appointments with them. This is not ideal for patients, as they need to start the rehabilitation process as soon as possible for a smooth and speedy recovery. With CopyClare, the rehabilitation process can be digitalised, allowing for remote physiotherapy. This has become even more relevant in the face of the pandemic.



Client introduction
-------------------

1) **Professor Joseph Connor.** Joseph represents the NHS and the British Elbow & Shoulder Society (BESS). He is our main client.

2) **Masters students - Neurophysiotheraphy researchers.** We collaborated with Masters students who wanted an application that could improve the physiotherapy process. We received feedback and suggestions on our UI from them, which we would incorporate into our UI design for an improved design, essentially enhancing the user experience on top of Joseph's main requirements.



Project goals
-------------

The main goal of CopyClare is to provide the same support to patients as an in-person session with a physiotherapist would. The UI needs to be as intuitive and simple as possible, while (according to the Masters students) being as engaging as possible, as the rehabilitation process is repetitive and 'boring' to many patients. It also aims to visualise the patient's progress, which will act as motivation to complete their assigned exercises.
